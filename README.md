# hello-world
Training and process improvement project
In my current role at Magento BI, I am the sole implementation specialist for all BI clients. I work with our clients and Account Managers from pre-planning requirements gathering through implementation finalization and transition to our beloved Customer Success team. Between those end points, I aid with data integration, validate inbound data, perform initial analysis and deploy impactful reporting tools and visualizations, and lead clients through their initial launch period.

I also do these things:
• Running in-depth demos to CTOs, Developers and Executives
• Assist in scoping out and implementing onboarding projects
• Creating value by uncovering insights from data and conducting training sessions and webinars.
• Work closely with the technical members of our various partners to ensure their success with customers and prospects
